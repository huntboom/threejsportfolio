        <h3>QuadBox Controllers</h3>
        <p>
           Built using React Three Fiber, users can customize and build their own fight-stick style controller, and then purchase their customized creation. The 3d model of the controller updates dynamically so that the user can create a controller personalized to them. Routing is done using React Router.
        </p>
        <p>
           This project was my first time using both React-Three-Fiber and React Router, it served as a rewarding learning experience. I hadn't used Three.js yet either at the time, so jumping straight to React-Three-Fiber provided an enticing challenge. I also decided to learn Zustand and utilize it over redux for this project as it uses less boilerplate and is well suited for a project of this size.

          <h3>Doggogram</h3>
          <p>An Instagram clone where users can only post photos of dogs. This site utilizes machine learning to verify that posts include a dog before the user posts. Built using NextJS, it has the core features of Instagram including user authentification through nextAuth, posting, commenting, liking and a UI that mirror's Instagram's. Utilizes Tensorflow for the dog image recognition. Hosted with vercel, uses firebase for backend to store posts data.</p>
          <p>Building a website based on a pre-existing site served as an excellent way to practice my CSS skills and bolster my understanding of NextJS. This was also an exciting way to learn more about machine learning modules. </p>

        <h3>Automation Bots</h3>
        <p>
            Fully Automated Youtube channel that utilizes Twitch's REST API to find and sort through clips and download them. The clips are then edited through a python script and compiled into a video that is uploaded to YouTube leveraging Selenium, automating several YouTube features not available through YouTube's API. The bot also uses modern web-scraping techniques to gain meta-data useful for pushing the curated videos through the YouTube algorithm.

         <h3>Bopified:A Spotify Clone</h3>
         <p>

          <h3>Drone Parts Planner</h3>
          <p>
            Website for drone enthusiasts to build a 3d render of their ideal drone using an intuitive part selector. Includes estimations on price scraped from meta-data from other sellers of the parts needed to build. Built using React Three Fiber and hosted with Firebase.
          </p>
          <p>
          As an avid drone building and flying enthusiast, I was disappointed to find that there was no sites available where users could find a comprehensive list of compatible drone parts and their corresponding prices, I wanted to change that so I built this site. Taking this a step further, I thought it'd be nice to see how the parts would all look together so I decided to use my skills in 3d modeling and ThreeJS/React-Three-Fiber so that I'd be able to see a 3d mockup of how the pieces would fit together.
